# Admin Service Management System - Complete Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a comprehensive admin service management system where:
1. **Providers create services** that require admin approval
2. **Admin reviews and approves/rejects** services 
3. **Admin can assign badges** to services (New on vividhood, Popular, Hot Deal, etc.)
4. **Only approved services** show on the frontend
5. **Bulk operations** for efficient admin management

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File: `backend/src/entities/service.entity.ts`**
- Added `ServiceStatus` enum with approval states:
  - `PENDING_APPROVAL` - New services await admin review
  - `APPROVED` - Admin approved services  
  - `REJECTED` - Admin rejected services
- Added admin approval fields:
  - `isApproved: boolean` - Approval status
  - `approvedByAdminId: string` - Which admin approved
  - `approvalDate: Date` - When approved/rejected
  - `adminComments: string` - Admin feedback
  - `adminAssignedBadge: string` - Badge assigned by admin
  - `adminQualityRating: number` - Admin quality rating (1-5)

### 2. Service Creation Logic
**File: `backend/src/modules/services/services.service.ts`**
- **New services default to:**
  - `status: PENDING_APPROVAL`
  - `isApproved: false`
  - `isActive: false`
- **Public queries only show approved services**
- **Provider queries show all their services**

### 3. Admin Service Management APIs
**File: `backend/src/modules/admin/admin.controller.ts`**
- `GET /admin/services` - Get all services with filters
- `GET /admin/services/stats` - Service statistics
- `GET /admin/services/:id` - Get service details
- `POST /admin/services/:id/approve` - Approve/reject service
- `PATCH /admin/services/:id/badge` - Assign badge
- `DELETE /admin/services/:id` - Delete service
- `POST /admin/services/bulk-action` - Bulk operations

### 4. Admin Service Logic
**File: `backend/src/modules/admin/admin.service.ts`**
- Service filtering and pagination
- Approval/rejection workflow
- Badge assignment system
- Bulk operations (approve, reject, delete, feature)
- Service statistics dashboard

### 5. DTOs for Type Safety
**File: `backend/src/modules/admin/dto/admin-service-approval.dto.ts`**
- `ApproveServiceDto` - Service approval data
- `AdminServiceQueryDto` - Service filtering
- `BulkServiceActionDto` - Bulk operations

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Admin Services API
**File: `frontend/src/store/api/adminServicesApi.ts`**
- RTK Query API for all admin service operations
- Type-safe interfaces for all service data
- Automatic cache invalidation on mutations

### 2. Admin Services Page
**File: `frontend/src/app/(admin)/services.tsx`**
- **Service Statistics Dashboard:**
  - Total, Approved, Pending, Featured services
  - Approval rate metrics
- **Advanced Filtering:**
  - Search by name/description
  - Filter by status, approval, provider, category
  - Pagination support
- **Service Management Table:**
  - Bulk selection with checkboxes
  - Quick approve/reject buttons
  - Badge assignment
  - Service details modal
- **Approval Modal:**
  - Detailed service review
  - Approval/rejection with comments
  - Badge assignment dropdown
  - Quality rating (1-5 stars)
- **Bulk Operations:**
  - Approve multiple services
  - Reject multiple services
  - Feature/unfeature services
  - Bulk delete

### 3. Custom Hooks
**File: `frontend/src/hooks/useAdminServices.ts`**
- `useAdminServices()` - Main admin services hook
- `useAdminServiceDetails()` - Individual service details
- Pre-built action handlers
- Status color utilities
- Badge options constants

### 4. Store Integration
**File: `frontend/src/store/index.ts`**
- Added `adminServicesApi` to Redux store
- Proper middleware configuration

## Badge System

### Available Badges
Admin can assign these badges to approved services:
- **New on vividhood** - For new providers/services
- **Popular** - High booking/rating services  
- **Hot Deal** - Special promotional services
- **Best Seller** - Top performing services
- **Limited Time** - Time-sensitive offers
- **Premium** - High-end services
- **Trending** - Currently popular
- **Editor's Choice** - Admin recommended

### Badge Assignment
1. **During Approval:** Admin can assign badge when approving
2. **Post-Approval:** Admin can modify badges anytime
3. **Provider Highlight Badge:** Shows on service cards
4. **Admin Assigned Badge:** Overrides provider badge

## Workflow

### 1. Provider Creates Service
```typescript
// Service defaults to pending approval
const service = {
  status: 'PENDING_APPROVAL',
  isApproved: false,
  isActive: false
}
```

### 2. Admin Reviews Service
```typescript
// Admin approves with badge and rating
await approveService({
  id: serviceId,
  data: {
    isApproved: true,
    adminComments: "Excellent service description",
    adminAssignedBadge: "Editor's Choice",
    adminQualityRating: 5
  }
});
```

### 3. Service Goes Live
```typescript
// On approval, service becomes:
const approvedService = {
  status: 'APPROVED',
  isApproved: true,
  isActive: true // Auto-activated
}
```

### 4. Frontend Display
```typescript
// Only approved services show in public queries
const publicServices = services.filter(s => 
  s.isApproved && s.isActive
);
```

## Migration Required

Run this SQL migration to add approval fields:
```sql
-- File: backend/add_service_approval_fields.sql
ALTER TABLE services ADD COLUMN is_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE services ADD COLUMN approved_by_admin_id UUID NULL;
ALTER TABLE services ADD COLUMN approval_date TIMESTAMP NULL;
ALTER TABLE services ADD COLUMN admin_comments TEXT NULL;
ALTER TABLE services ADD COLUMN admin_assigned_badge VARCHAR(100) NULL;
ALTER TABLE services ADD COLUMN admin_quality_rating DECIMAL(3,2) NULL;

-- Set existing services as approved
UPDATE services SET is_approved = TRUE WHERE status = 'active';
```

## Usage Example

### Admin Approving a Service
```typescript
const { handleApproveService } = useAdminServices();

await handleApproveService(
  'service-id',
  true, // approve
  'Great service with clear description',
  'Editor\'s Choice',
  5 // 5-star rating
);
```

### Provider Service Creation
```typescript
// Provider creates service - goes to pending
const newService = await createService({
  name: 'Professional Manicure',
  description: 'Complete nail care service',
  // ... other fields
  // Automatically set to pending approval
});
```

This system ensures quality control while providing efficient admin management tools for scaling the platform.
