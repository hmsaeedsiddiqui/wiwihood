## How it works:

1. User clicks "Book Now" on service detail page
2. Redirects to `/services/book-now?service=service-slug&serviceId=123&provider=456`
3. Book now page loads and:
   - Fetches all services from the provider
   - Auto-selects the primary service
   - Sets the correct category
   - Updates Redux booking state
   - Shows provider information
4. User can add more services from the same provider
5. Click "Continue" proceeds to time selection

## URL Format:
```
/services/book-now?service=luxury-nail-service&serviceId=uuid&provider=provider-uuid
```

## Testing:
1. Go to any service detail page
2. Click "Book Now" 
3. Should redirect to book-now page with service pre-selected
4. Provider info should be displayed correctly
5. Service should be highlighted as "Primary"
6. Can add/remove additional services
7. Total pricing updates dynamically
